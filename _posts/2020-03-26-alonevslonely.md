"Why you lonely?", a friendly Filipino woman asked when I was on vacation on Cebu island, all by myself. "I'm not lonely, I'm just alone", I replied. I always needed more time for myself than the average person. My mom still vividly tells the story of how we had guests staying at our place for several days when I was a kid. On the third day, I asked the other children to leave my room because I wanted to play alone.

Fast forward more than twenty years, I find myself in the United States as a visiting PhD student. I was looking forward to meeting many new people, working with them, laughing with them, sharing stories and beers. But my life in the US is not what I imagined. Everyone is busy. People work a lot, but not with me. They rarely go for beers. The semester did not start yet, I don't have an office, I don't have friends. Not only am I alone, I am also lonely. I don't even go to campus anymore. I can work from anywhere, so why bother going to chilly libraries? After a few weeks of isolation, I take the necessary steps to end my misery. I set myself a goal of talking to one new person per week. The first person I talk to helps me to find some office space. Joining a Lindy Hop dancing club is fun and leads to a larger social network. Starting a new sport makes me feel proud and confident. I finally enjoy life again.

I'm an introvert. While extroverts flourish in stimulating environments, introverts get overstimulated quickly and need more quiet time to process things. The world is not black and white, and we all have both a need to relax and to gain new experiences. A typical introvert just needs more me-time compared to a typical extrovert. The freedom of a PhD enables me to choose the level of stimulation that is right for me. Being alone has always been a crucial part of my well-being. But even for an introvert, a lack of social activities can lead to loneliness.

Introverts, extroverts, and everyone in between should monitor their levels of of social interaction in these times of social distancing. The bad news is that you are mostly stuck wherever you live - be it alone, with your family, or with flatmates. Depending on your living situation, you will forcibly either have very few social interactions or be confined to hang out with the same people over and over. The good news is that we are all in the same boat and everybody is happy to video call now. I tried to schedule a call with one friend per day. In the last couple of days, some work calls sneaked into my schedule and I started to feel drained. After two professional calls and a private one, I just collapsed on the sofa, feeling as if I had accomplished a tremendous task and needed to rest. Being aware of this problem, I will adjust my plans for the coming week.

What level of interaction do you need? How does an ideal week of socializing look like for you in normal times? And how can you maintain your optimal level of socializing while self-isolating? Thinking about these questions can help you to feel balanced and fulfilled.

Let's all not be lonely, just alone.
