Hi, I'm Dora. Here are some quick facts about me:

- researcher on International Trade and Environmental Economics
- passionate but slow runner
- very European: lived in five different European countries
- always on a quest for self-improvement
- concerned about mental health in academia
- probably even more concerned about climate change and the environment

On this blog, I share the lessons I learned on my journey of becoming a researcher. I hope to inspire both young researchers and the general public by giving insights into the life in academia.
