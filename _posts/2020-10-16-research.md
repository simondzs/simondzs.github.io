## Greening Ricardo: Environmental Comparative Advantage and the Environmental Gains From Trade

*M. Le Moigne, S. Lepot, R. Ossa, M. Ritel, D. Simon, 2025*

Abstract: We show that climate policy can unlock large environmental gains from trade by inducing countries to specialize according to their environmental comparative advantage. We make this point by exploring the effects of a carbon tax in a quantitative trade model. Our main result is that the environmental gains from trade account for over one-third of the total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by the carbon tax. This finding holds for a wide range of carbon tax rates and coverages.

## The Distributional Effects of Carbon Pricing Across Countries


*M. Le Moigne, S. Lepot, M. Ritel, D. Simon 2025*

Abstract: We use a quantitative international trade model with climate policies to explore the distributional effects of carbon pricing across countries. Our analysis addresses two key questions facing global climate action: which countries bear the greatest burden of climate policies, and how these policies can be designed to ensure fairness. We present three main findings. First, efficient climate policies that disregard distributional concerns significantly exacerbate between-country inequality. Second, equity can be achieved alongside efficiency when climate policies are complemented by realistic international transfers, either equalizing carbon tax costs or accounting for historical emissions, with minimal economic impact on high-income countries. Third, carbon tax schemes with heterogeneous pricing—featuring lower rates for low- and middle-income countries— do not necessarily result in fairer outcomes.

## To Beef or Not To Beef: Trade, Meat, and the Environment

*D. Simon, 2025*

Abstract: How can food consumption choice reduce emissions? I estimate a demand model using purchasing data of meat and other protein rich products from a European retailer and combine it with data on production and transport emissions. In counterfactual exercises, I analyze the reaction of consumers to food consumption policies. I find that buying local only decreases emissions by around 2% compared to the status quo. Vegetarian scenarios lead to the largest decrease in emissions of more than 20%. Pigouvian taxes lead to emissions reductions of 8-21%. These findings underscore the role of consumer choices in shaping food-related emissions.

## Trade, Trump, and Emissions

*S. Lepot, M. Ritel, D. Simon 2025*

Abstract: This paper examines the unintended effects of noncooperative tariff hikes on global greenhouse gas emissions. Using a multi-country, multi-industry quantitative trade policy model, we evaluate protectionist and retaliatory scenarios shaped by the current geopolitical landscape and assess their impact on the carbon footprint of international trade. Our findings reveal that while noncooperative tariffs suppress economic activity - leading to modest emission reductions - they also restructure trade networks in ways that increase reliance on carbon-intensive production. As a result, arbitrary protectionist measures risk driving globalization towards a less sustainable path.

## Consumption Slowdown after the Great Recession

*D. Simon, V. Sulaja, 2022*

Abstract: Consumption growth in the United States slowed markedly following the 2007–2009 financial crisis. We argue that costly regulatory interventions targeting banks with foreclosure-related misconduct contributed to this decline by constraining credit supply. Using variation in county-level exposure to affected banks, we show that tighter regulatory controls reduced mortgage loan origination, leading to weaker house price recoveries and lower household wealth. We find that consumption growth slowed more in counties more exposed to these banks, consistent with a wealth effect transmitted through housing markets. The decline in mortgage lending reflects a reduction in the number of loans rather than in average loan size, suggesting that regulation operated primarily through extensive-margin credit supply.
